Exploring the Github Page
=============================

What we mainly do on the website is search for sample code or look for projects that our peers are working on. The search functionality in Github is incredibly robust - and allows you to filter by coding language (Java, R, C, and much more). Try searching for your favorite algorithm - chances are you'll uncover many repositories with related code. You can even try finding yourself! Search your first and last name, and then click Users. If you have put this information in your Github profile you should see your username. If you don't, try filling in your profile with as much information as you're comfortable sharing, then try again.

Now click the "Octocat" logo in the top left to return to the main Github page. You can see a few different things going on here:

* News Feed: Contains activity for people and repositories that you have bookmarked (also called “watching”)

* Pull Requests link: Pull requests are messages that let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. It initiates a living conversation that streamlines the process of discussing, reviewing, and managing changes (i.e. Code Review).

* Issues link: Issues are a way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email — except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team, and they "live" with your code rather than being separate. 

* Repositories: A list of your repositories and those you contribute to.


Some other notable features:

* Github Readme’s/Markdown: Github uses markdown language to format text, mention other users, repositories, and issues very easily. https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

* Github Wiki: Wiki’s help you create documentation for complex projects where a simple readme won’t do. https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/

* Github Pages: GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. https://guides.github.com/features/pages/

* Github Organizations: With teams, you can give your developers as much or as little power as they need — from the ability to create projects on behalf of your organization to read-only access on existing projects.

Browse around the page for yourself and check out what your friends are doing! Of course, you're probably now interested in understanding how to *work with others* in Github - Looking at everyone's work isn't exactly collaboration.
