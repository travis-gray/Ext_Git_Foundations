Github is a way to work collaboratively and share your work with the rest of the company. It was founded in San Francisco in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett as a community for developing and managing open source code using Git—the independent version-control software created by Linus Torvalds.  Now it has grown from a self-proclaimed “weekend project” in 2008 to what is arguably the world’s most powerful software development tool, with a $750M valuation.

One of the main misconceptions about GitHub is that it is purely a development tool (like a computer languages or compilers). However, GitHub is also a social network like Facebook or Tumblr.

Create a profile, upload projects to share, and connect with other users (Through "Following" or "Watching" functionality). And while many users store code projects on Github, there’s nothing preventing you from keeping simple text documents or other file types in your project folders.

Please follow along this tutorial by using the directions on the top of the page.

So are you ready to start coding outside of your silo?
